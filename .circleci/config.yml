# main point of this config is to build asp.net core app in windows and then deploy it from linux by ssh to remote server
# the problem was in windows and linux, because of different system structure
# so it was needed to use persist_to_workspace to pass build files from windows to linux

jobs:
  build:
    executor: win/default
    # setting our path to somewhere ~/app-build
    # now we are at C:/Users/circleci/app-build
    working_directory: ~/app-build
    steps:
      # uploading repository to our path(~/app-build)
      - checkout

      # persisting build files to workspace
      - persist_to_workspace:

          paths: # specifying path we want to persist

  deploy:
    machine:
      image: ubuntu-1604:201903-01

          at: ~/app-build
          # here we'll have next structure
          # /home/circleci/app-build (it's not the same as in first job because it's linux machine but not windows as in first job)
          # - bin (folder we asked to persist)
